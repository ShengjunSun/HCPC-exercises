For this week; I actively practiced 7 coding problems related with applying greedy algorithm. 

The problems are from this link: 
https://vjudge.net/contest/547495

A - CodeForces 1353B
B - CodeForces 472C
C - CodeForces 1765B
D - CodeForces 1486A
E - CodeForces 1791G1
F - CodeForces 1742F
G - CodeForces 497C

For G; my code is running too slow.
